    * Before attempting to write any Java, state what it is intended to test.
    * I've seen Gherkins before and used them to describe manual tests.
    * I've never had any formal training in their use or researched their syntax before now.
    *
    *
    * Feature: Tables page of herokuapp.com website
    *
    *   The heading paragraph has been run through Grammerly. It indicated "which is" an incorrect pronoun usage.
    *   This should be checked with the author to see whether this should state "that is". In the meantime, assume
    *   this paragraph is correct and use this as the baseline check to test for any changes
    *
    * Scenario: Check heading and static text in Data Tables section
    *
    * Given Web browser is open at https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables

    * Scenario: Check table header in Examples section
    *
    * Given Web browser is open at https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables and an example is displayed on screen
    * When the header row is compared to expected results
    * Then the screen text and the expected result text are identical.
    *

    *
    * Given Web browser is open at https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables

    * And there is data in the table
    * Then it is possible to capture and store the data
    *
